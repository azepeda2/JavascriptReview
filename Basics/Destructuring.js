// you can use destructuring to assign values to variables from objects and arrays
// you can also use destructuring to pass objects and arrays as arguments to functions
// you can also use destructuring to assign default values to variables

let PI = Math.PI;
console.log(PI); // 3.141592653589793

// this only works if the variable name is the same as the property name

// if I where to misname the variable, it would be undefined

let pi = Math.pi;
console.log(pi); // undefined

// this only works if the variable name is the same as the property name
// as shown in the first example
